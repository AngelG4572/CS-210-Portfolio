# CS-210-Portfolio

Portfolio Questions: 
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    Corner Grocer is a project that encapsulates our learning about classes, and also our final project. Corner Grocer, a local grocery store, needs to track what items are being bought and their frequency in order to rearrange their shelving and maximize space. This item-tracking program has 3 main functionalities: look up the frequency of a specific item, display all items with their frequencies, and display all items with frequencies as a histogram. 
2. What did you do particularly well?
    My strength comes from being able to create methods and be able to come up with a solution for all problems.
3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    I still have much to learn when it comes to classes and implementing classes properly. Even though my code works, I'm not sure I used the classes in the most efficient way. This project was also the first time that I had used maps, and I had to familiarize myself with it fairly quickly. 
4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    When writing the code for Corner Grocer's Item Tracking, I started off by writing all of my code in one file, making sure it worked, and then separating it into 3 different files and implementing a class. This was very challenging for me because there were things that worked while it was all in one file, but then it would cause bugs when transferred to a class. I overcame this by reading up on classes and better understanding their functionality. I also turned to the internet and searched the error messages I was getting in order to understand why my code wasn't working. Stack Overflow is a great tool, and so is W3Schools. 
5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    Skills from this project that I'll take into other projects include object oriented programming, my knowledge of classes, and problem solving. 
6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    In order to make this code readable, I followed naming conventions and syntax, and I also included comments for each of my functions briefly explaining their purpose.
